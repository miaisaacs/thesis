# thesis

this is the repository for my MPH thesis data analysis. this project focuses on identifying specific reactive linear 
epitopes with the purpose of distinguishing dengue virus (DENV) serotypes. additionally, these responses will be 
characterized across acute vs. convalescent phase timepoints and assessed for cross-reactivity with other flaviviruses.
